##todo long term
    1. nasdaq stock screener is currently being read as a csv on disk
            I should be able to pull from web
    2. pullYahooFinance should be from lastupdated to today instead of just "does not have yahoohistorical pull default"
    3.i think I can put imports in __init__.py?
